# Empower_Android

- What the project does

  This porject is aim to build the Android application "Empower". Which will be helping the physically disabled people get more involved in sports and keep their spirits up. 

- Why the project is useful

  People with disabilities of any physical condition feel restricted when it comes to participation in sports and the percentage of disabled people engaging in sports is way worse than abled people. One of the reasons for this is that they don't know what's available for them in terms of where they can go to participate in a certain sport or a safe place for general exercise.
  It is also reported that disabled people face inefficient and ineffective access to information regarding the local sport and recreational facilities that are within their reach. The need to develop a better relationship between physically disabled people and sports aided with motivation and inspiration is also seen.
